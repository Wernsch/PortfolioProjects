## About Me:

With a background that spans approximately 8 years across various sectors, my journey has encompassed roles in consulting, working with a DAX-listed corporation, and most recently, diving deep into the telecommunications sector. Throughout my career, I have extensively engaged with compliance, risk management, and IT-centric projects.

Over the past few years, my focus shifted towards data analysis, culminating in the completion of a specialized certificate program and achieving proficiency in Python. My overarching goal is to bring my deep expertise to the forefront in roles that are centered around digitalization or are intrinsically tied to it. 

Have fun checking out the portfolio projects.
Thanks
